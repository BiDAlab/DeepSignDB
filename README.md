## **DESCRIPTION OF DeepSignDB**

The DeepSignDB database comprises a total of 1526 users from four different popular databases and a novel signature database not presented yet, named e-BioSign DS2. Fig. 1 graphically summarises the design, acquisition devices, and writing tools considered in the DeepSignDB database.

Figure 1. Description of the design, acquisition devices, and writing tools considered in the new DeepSignDB database. A total of 1526 users and 8 different captured devices are used (5 Wacom and 3 Samsung general purpose devices). For the Samsung devices, signatures are also collected using the finger. Gen. Sig. = Genuine Signatures, and Sk. Forg. = Skilled Forgeries.

A short description of each database regarding the device, writing input, number of acquisition sessions and time gap between them, and type of impostors is included inside the paper [ArXiv2020_DeepSign].

## **STANDARD EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL**

The **DeepSignDB** database has been **divided into two different datasets,** one for the development and training of the system and the other one for the final evaluation. **The development dataset comprises around 70% of the users of each database whereas the remaining 30% are included in the evaluation dataset**. It is important to note that each dataset comprises different users in order to avoid biased results. Thus, we first identified all those users that took part in the acquisition of different databases.

For the training of the systems, the **development dataset** comprises a total of 1084 users. In our experiments carried out in [ArXiv2020_DeepSign], we have divided this dataset into two different subsets, training (80%) and validation (20%). However, as this dataset is used only for development, and not for the final evaluation of the systems, **we prefer not to set any restriction and let researchers use it as they like.**

For the **final testing of the systems**, the remaining 442 users of the DeepSignDB database are included in the **evaluation dataset**. In order to **perform a complete and fair analysis of the signature verification systems**, and see their generalization capacity to different scenarios, aspects such as the inter-session variability, number of training signatures, impostor scenario, and writing input (stylus/finger) have been considered in the final experimental protocol design. 

**Table 1** describes all the experimental protocol details of the DeepSignDB **evaluation dataset** for both stylus (top) and finger (bottom) writing inputs.

All data provided is organised as follows:

```shell

    |-- Finger
    |-- Stylus
|-- Evaluation
    |-- Finger
    |-- Stylus

```

We provide all details regarding comparison files and nomenclature in the “README.pdf” file send it when applying for the DeepSignDB database. 


## **EVALUATION RESULTS**

Table 2 and 3 provide the **evaluation performance results** of our proposed TA-RNN approach for the **whole DeepSignDB** evaluation dataset and for **each of the databases** included in it when using the stylus and finger as input. In addition, we compare the proposed TA-RNNs [ArXiv2020_DeepSign] with other popular approaches such as DTW and RNNs for completeness. All details are included in [ArXiv2020_DeepSign].
